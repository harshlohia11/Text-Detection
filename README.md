# Text-Detection
<h2>This is a program with the help of which you can detect text on a image or a live video stream from your webcam.</h2>

I have used the pre trained EAST model that detects the texts and return the bounding coordinates of the text in that particular image or a video frame.
You can download the pre trained model from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2">here</a>

<h3>Pre-requisites to run the codes</h3>
    
You should have the following packages installed-
<ul>
  <li>OpenCV- pip install OpenCv</li>
  <li>Imutils- pip install imutils</li>
  <li>numpy- pip install numpy</li>
 </ul>
 
 If you have installed the above packages then you are good to execute the code.
